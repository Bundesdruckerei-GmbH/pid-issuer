            processed in a log file. The following data is stored:

            In the event of attacks (e.g., DDoS attacks) on the communication systems, this data is analyzed and, if
            necessary, used to initiate legal and criminal prosecution. These log files are deleted after seven days at
            the
            latest. The legal basis for this processing of your personal data is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our legitimate

        <h2>4. Storage periods</h2>
